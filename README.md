Moviepalooza APP by: James Peterson

For my third project in WDI12, I created an app that allows movie fans to find and read reviews for different movies featured on the site. Once users enter my site by making an account featured on the UserPage, they are given many moviess to choose from along with a trailer and screenshot for the particular movie. After reading the review for the movie the user has selected, they are then given a link that allows them to either buy or rent the movie from amazon.com. Admin features include being able to add/delete a user.

Technologies used:

HTML5 CSS JavaScript jQuery Node.js Express.js React MongoDB.js Heroku (used to deploy the finalized working app)

FEATURES: Trailers for each movie presented. Screenshot of each movie presented with the review flex wrapped around the image. Clickable link that allows you to buy/rent movie selected.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:

I would love to make my website responsive mobile friendly. I tried for several hours the day before presentations to get it right and working and I failed about halfway through. That will definitely be a goal to come back and reach once the course ends so that I can have one site in my portfolio that is mobile friendly. I will say that I feel far far better at the end of this project than I did at the beginning of this project. Having the annotations and stuff that Danny and Jamie wrote in while working and building really really helped me understand how react works. It is still abit tedious and complicated but I do feel far better at reading and understanding it as well as using it than I did the day they introduced it.
