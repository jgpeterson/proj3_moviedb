Moviepalooza APP by: James Peterson

For my third project in WDI12, I created an app that allows movie fans to find and read reviews for different movies featured on the site. Once users enter my site by making an account featured on the UserPage, they are given many moviess to choose from along with a trailer and screenshot for the particular movie. After reading the review for the movie the user has selected, they are then given a link that allows them to either buy or rent the movie from amazon.com. Admin features include being able to add/delete a user.

Technologies used:

HTML5 CSS JavaScript jQuery Node.js Express.js React MongoDB.js Heroku (used to deploy the finalized working app)

FEATURES: Trailers for each movie presented. Screenshot of each movie presented with the review flex wrapped around the image. Clickable link that allows you to buy/rent movie selected.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:

I would love to master CSS a bit more on the next project as well as adding other cool site features. But all in all, Ill say that I feel far far better at the end of this project than I did at the end of project 1. Having the annotations and stuff that Danny wrote in while working and building really really helped me understand how routes work and what they do. I feel ready for Project 3.
